# FNSB-CWPP-GIMM-ground-ice-extrapolation
The purpose of this repository is to present the process of extrapolating ground ice labels from the ground ice extent to the entire Fairbanks CWPP study region.
Please see the "READ_ME_2021..." file for a full description of workflow.
Some files are needed to replicate these efforts were too large to upload to Github. A full set of all files can be found here on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HwD2e8lnhJaefVQD_3BAEmI_7lRarxPz?usp=drive_link
